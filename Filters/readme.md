# Angular Filters

1. Create a single value filter named "secure" that transforms any url to a secure url i.e to "https".
2. Create an angular application that has a text box that enables you to search for a link in a list by title.
3. Hard code the following list of links (you can add your own) and render them to a list.
   Use the Title property as the Text of the links and the url as the href.
```javascript 
[ 
   { title: "CNN News", url: "http://www.cnn.com" },
   { title: "Facebook", url: "http://www.facebook.com" },
   { title: "Github", url: "https://www.github.com" },
   { title: "Angular Forms", url: "https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/forms" },
   { title: "jQuery UI", url: "http://api.jqueryui.com/" },
   { title: "W3C", url: "http://www.w3schools.com/" },
   { title: "Stackoverflow", url: "http://stackoverflow.com/" }
]
```
